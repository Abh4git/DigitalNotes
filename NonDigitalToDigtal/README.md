This focuses on operational paradoxes in the digital world and practical advice for organizations to drive operational transformation through digital strategies.

1. **Operational Paradoxes of the Non-Digital World**:
   The diagram illustrates four operational paradoxes that organizations must navigate to exploit the power of core operations in the digital world:
   - **Standardizing vs. Empowering**: This refers to the balance between creating standardized processes and empowering employees to make decisions and act with agility.
   - **Controlling vs. Innovating**: Organizations need to maintain control over their operations while fostering innovation that can drive them forward.
   - **Orchestrating vs. Unleashing**: Companies must orchestrate their resources and processes to run efficiently, but also unleash creativity and innovation within their teams.

2. **Exploiting the Power of Core Operations**:
   The key actions for improving operations include:
   - Considering how each of the six operational levers (from the paradoxes above) can help enhance core operations.
   - Starting with **standardization or control** when it is difficult to address both sides of the paradox, as this can open up possibilities to address other levers like innovation or empowerment later.
   - Drawing inspiration from inside and outside the industry for operational improvements.
   - Recognizing that a strong digital platform is essential for **operational transformation**.

3. **Leading Digital Checklist: Operations**:
   This checklist provides key recommendations for operational transformation in the digital age:
   - **Free yourself from old assumptions** from the pre-digital age: Many legacy assumptions about how businesses should run may no longer be valid.
   - **Look for bottlenecks and inefficiencies**: Identify problem areas in existing processes and explore whether digital technologies can be used to rethink and improve these operations.

In summary, it emphasizes the need for companies to manage the operational paradoxes that arise when implementing digital strategies. They should focus on finding the right balance between control, standardization, and unleashing innovation, while also freeing themselves from outdated operational assumptions and leveraging digital tools to improve efficiency and flexibility in core processes.
